1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. 
2 And he prayed to the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before to Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest of the evil. 
3 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. 
4 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry? 
5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city. 
6 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. 
7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. 
8 And it came to pass, when the sun rose that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. 
9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even to death. 
10 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not labored, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: 
11 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also many cattle?
