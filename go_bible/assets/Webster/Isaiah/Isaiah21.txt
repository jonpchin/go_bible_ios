1 The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land. 
2 A grievous vision is declared to me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler plundereth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all her sighing have I made to cease. 
3 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it. 
4 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear to me. 
5 Prepare the table, watch in the watch-tower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield. 
6 For thus hath the Lord said to me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth. 
7 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed: 
8 And he cried, a lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day time, and I am set in my ward whole nights. 
9 And behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken to the ground. 
10 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor; that which I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared to you. 
11 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night? 
12 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: return, come. 
13 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye traveling companies of Dedanim. 
14 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they met with their bread him that fled. 
15 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. 
16 For thus hath the Lord said to me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail: 
17 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.
