1 Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll. 
2 And he said to me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; its length is twenty cubits, and its breadth ten cubits. 
3 Then said he to me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it. 
4 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it with its timber and its stones. 
5 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now thy eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth. 
6 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth. 
7 And behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah. 
8 And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon its mouth. 
9 Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked and behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven. 
10 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the ephah? 
11 And he said to me, To build for it a house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.
