1 A Song of degrees of David. LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor my eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me. 
2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned by his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child. 
3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
