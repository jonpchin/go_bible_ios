1 A Song of degrees. To thee I raise my eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. 
2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until he shall have mercy upon us. 
3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us; for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 
4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
