1 A Song of degrees. They that trust in the LORD, shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever. 
2 As the mountains are round Jerusalem, so the LORD is around his people from henceforth even for ever. 
3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands to iniquity. 
4 Do good, O LORD, to those that are good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. 
5 As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
