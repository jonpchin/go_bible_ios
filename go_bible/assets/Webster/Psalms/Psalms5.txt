1 To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation. 
2 Hearken to the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for to thee will I pray. 
3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer to thee, and will look up. 
4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee. 
5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity. 
6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak falsehood: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man. 
7 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship towards thy holy temple. 
8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness, because of my enemies; make thy way straight before my face. 
9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulcher; they flatter with their tongue. 
10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee. 
11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee. 
12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favor wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
