1 A Psalm of David. Give to the LORD, O ye mighty, give to the LORD glory and strength. 
2 Give to the LORD, the glory due to his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness. 
3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters. 
4 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. 
5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yes, the LORD breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 
6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion like a young unicorn. 
7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire. 
8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh the wilderness of Kadesh. 
9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and maketh bare the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory. 
10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yes, the LORD sitteth king for ever. 
11 The LORD will give strength to his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
