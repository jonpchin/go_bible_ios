1 A Prayer of David. Bow down thy ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy. 
2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee. 
3 Be merciful to me, O Lord: for I cry to thee daily. 
4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for to thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul. 
5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and abundant in mercy to all them that call upon thee. 
6 Give ear, O LORD, to my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications. 
7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me. 
8 Among the gods there is none like thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like thy works. 
9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name. 
10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone. 
11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name. 
12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore. 
13 For great is thy mercy towards me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell. 
14 O God, the proud have risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them. 
15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious; long-suffering, and abundant in mercy and truth. 
16 O turn to me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength to thy servant, and save the son of thy handmaid. 
17 Show me a token for good; that they who hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast helped me, and comforted me.
