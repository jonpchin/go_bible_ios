1 To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David. Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer. 
2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah. 
3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call to him. 
4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. 
5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD. 
6 There are many that say, Who will show us any good? LORD, lift thou upon us the light of thy countenance. 
7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time when their corn and their wine increased. 
8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep; for thou only, LORD, makest me dwell in safety.
