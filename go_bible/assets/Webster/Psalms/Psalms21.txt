1 To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David. The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice! 
2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withheld the request of his lips. Selah. 
3 For thou hast met him with the blessings of goodness: thou hast set a crown of pure gold on his head. 
4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it to him, even length of days for ever and ever. 
5 His glory is great in thy salvation: honor and majesty hast thou laid upon him. 
6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance. 
7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved. 
8 Thy hand shall find out all thy enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee. 
9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thy anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them. 
10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men. 
11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform. 
12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thy arrows upon thy strings against the face of them. 
13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thy own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.
