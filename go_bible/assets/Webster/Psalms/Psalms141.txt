1 A Psalm of David. LORD, I cry to thee: make haste to me; give ear to my voice, when I cry to thee. 
2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice. 
3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips. 
4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practice wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties. 
5 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities. 
6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet. 
7 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth. 
8 But my eyes are to thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute. 
9 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity. 
10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst I escape.
