1 A Psalm of David. LORD, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thy holy hill? 
2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. 
3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor. 
4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoreth them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. 
5 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
