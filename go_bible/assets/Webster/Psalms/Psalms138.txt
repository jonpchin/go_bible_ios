1 A Psalm of David. I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I sing praise to thee. 
2 I will worship towards thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy loving-kindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name. 
3 In the day when I cried thou didst answer me, and strengthen me with strength in my soul. 
4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth. 
5 Yes, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the glory of the LORD. 
6 Though the LORD is high, yet hath he respect to the lowly: but the proud he knoweth afar off. 
7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me: thou wilt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies, and thy right hand will save me. 
8 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works thy own hands.
