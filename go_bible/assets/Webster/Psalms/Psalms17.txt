1 A Prayer of David. Hear the right, O LORD, attend to my cry, give ear to my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips. 
2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thy eyes behold the things that are equal. 
3 Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I have purposed that my mouth shall not transgress. 
4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer. 
5 Uphold my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not. 
6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thy ear to me, and hear my speech. 
7 Show thy wonderful loving-kindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them who put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them. 
8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shade of thy wings. 
9 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who encompass me, 
10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly. 
11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth; 
12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places. 
13 Arise, O LORD disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, who is thy sword: 
14 From men who are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, who have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes. 
15 As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
