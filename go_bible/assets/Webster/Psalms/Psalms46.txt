1 To the chief Musician for the sons of Korah, A Song upon Alamoth. God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. 
2 Therefore will we not fear, though the earth shall be removed, and though the mountains shall be carried into the midst of the sea; 
3 Though its waters shall roar and be disturbed, though the mountains shake with the swelling of it. Selah. 
4 There is a river, the streams of which shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High. 
5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early. 
6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted. 
7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah. 
8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 
9 He maketh wars to cease to the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear asunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire. 
10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth. 
11 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
