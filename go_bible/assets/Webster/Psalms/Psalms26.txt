1 A Psalm of David. Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in my integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide. 
2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart. 
3 For thy loving-kindness is before my eyes: and I have walked in thy truth. 
4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers. 
5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked. 
6 I will wash my hands in innocence: so will I compass thy altar, O LORD: 
7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works. 
8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thy honor dwelleth. 
9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men: 
10 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes. 
11 But as for me, I will walk in my integrity: redeem me, and be merciful to me. 
12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
