1 A Psalm of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name. 
2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits: 
3 Who forgiveth all thy iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases; 
4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with loving-kindness and tender mercies; 
5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's. 
6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed. 
7 He made known his ways to Moses, his acts to the children of Israel. 
8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in mercy. 
9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever. 
10 He hath not dealt with us according to our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. 
11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy towards them that fear him. 
12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us. 
13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. 
14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. 
15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. 
16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and its place shall know it no more. 
17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness to children's children; 
18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them. 
19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all. 
20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word. 
21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure. 
22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
