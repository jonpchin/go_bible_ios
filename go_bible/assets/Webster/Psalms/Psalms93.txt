1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, with which he hath girded himself: the world also is established, that it cannot be moved. 
2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 
3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift their waves. 
4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yes, than the mighty waves of the sea. 
5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thy house, O LORD, for ever.
