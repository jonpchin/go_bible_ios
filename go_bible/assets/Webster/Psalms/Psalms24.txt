1 A Psalm of David. The earth is the LORD'S, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein. 
2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods. 
3 Who shall ascend upon the hill of the LORD? and who shall stand in his holy place? 
4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul to vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. 
5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 
6 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah. 
7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. 
8 Who is this King of glory? the LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle. 
9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in. 
10 Who is this King of glory? the LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.
