1 To the chief Musician, Al-taschith, Michtam of David, when he fled from Saul in the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me: for my soul trusteth in thee: yes, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities are overpast. 
2 I will cry to God most high; to God that performeth all things for me. 
3 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth. 
4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 
5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth. 
6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down: they have digged a pit before me, into the midst of which they have fallen themselves. Selah. 
7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and give praise. 
8 Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 
9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing to thee among the nations. 
10 For thy mercy is great to the heavens, and thy truth to the clouds. 
11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be above all the earth.
