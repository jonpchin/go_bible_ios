1 To the chief Musician upon Shoshannim, for the sons of Korah, Maschil, A Song of loves. My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made concerning the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer. 
2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever. 
3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty. 
4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. 
5 Thy arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; by which the people fall under thee. 
6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom is a scepter of justice. 
7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. 
8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made thee glad. 
9 Kings daughters were among thy honorable women: upon thy right hand stood the queen in gold of Ophir. 
10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thy ear; forget also thy own people, and thy father's house; 
11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy lord; and worship thou him. 
12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favor. 
13 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold. 
14 She shall be brought to the king in raiment of needle-work: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought to thee. 
15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace. 
16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth. 
17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
