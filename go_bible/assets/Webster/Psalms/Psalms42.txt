1 To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah. As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so my soul panteth after thee, O God. 
2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 
3 My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say to me, Where is thy God? 
4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holy-day. 
5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance. 
6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar. 
7 Deep calleth to deep at the noise of thy water-spouts: all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me. 
8 Yet the LORD will command his loving-kindness in the day-time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer to the God of my life. 
9 I will say to God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy? 
10 As with a sword in my bones, my enemies reproach me; while they say daily to me, Where is thy God? 
11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.
