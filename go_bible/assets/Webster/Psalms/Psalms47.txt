1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. O clap your hands, all ye people; shout to God with the voice of triumph. 
2 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth. 
3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 
4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellence of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 
5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet. 
6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises to our King, sing praises. 
7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with understanding. 
8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness. 
9 The princes of the people are assembled, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong to God: he is greatly exalted.
