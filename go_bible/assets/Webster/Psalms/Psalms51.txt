1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bath-sheba. Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving-kindness: according to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. 
2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. 
3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me. 
4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest. 
5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me. 
6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom. 
7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. 
8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice. 
9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. 
10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me. 
11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me. 
12 Restore to me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit. 
13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted to thee. 
14 Deliver me from blood-guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness. 
15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall show forth thy praise. 
16 For thou desirest not sacrifice: else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt-offering. 
17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise. 
18 Do good in thy good pleasure to Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem. 
19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thy altar.
