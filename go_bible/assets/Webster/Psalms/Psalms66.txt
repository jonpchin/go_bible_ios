1 To the chief Musician, A Song or Psalm. Make a joyful noise to God, all ye lands: 
2 Sing forth the honor of his name: make his praise glorious. 
3 Say to God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thy enemies submit themselves to thee. 
4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing to thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah. 
5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing towards the children of men. 
6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there we rejoiced in him. 
7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah. 
8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard: 
9 Who holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved. 
10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried. 
11 Thou hast brought us into the net; thou hast laid affliction upon our loins. 
12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place. 
13 I will go into thy house with burnt-offerings: I will pay thee my vows, 
14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble. 
15 I will offer to thee burnt-sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah. 
16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul. 
17 I cried to him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue. 
18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me: 
19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer. 
20 Blessed be God, who hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
