1 A Psalm of David. To thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou shouldst be silent to me, I should become like them that go down into the pit. 
2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry to thee, when I lift my hands towards thy holy oracle. 
3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors, but mischief is in their hearts. 
4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavors: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert. 
5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he will destroy them, and not build them up. 
6 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications. 
7 The LORD is my strength, and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him. 
8 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed. 
9 Save thy people, and bless thy inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.
