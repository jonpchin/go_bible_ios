1 A Song of degrees of David. I was glad when they said to me, Let us go into the house of the LORD. 
2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem. 
3 Jerusalem is built as a city that is compact together: 
4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, to the testimony of Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD. 
5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David. 
6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. 
7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces. 
8 For my brethren and companions' sake, I will now say, Peace be within thee. 
9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
