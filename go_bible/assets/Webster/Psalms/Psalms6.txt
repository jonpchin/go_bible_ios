1 To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are agitated. 
3 My soul is also greatly disquieted: but thou, O LORD, how long? 
4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: Oh save me for thy mercies sake. 
5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who will give thee thanks? 
6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night I make my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears. 
7 My eye is consumed because of grief; it groweth old because of all my enemies. 
8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping. 
9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer. 
10 Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly disquieted: let them return and be suddenly ashamed.
