1 Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust. 
2 O my soul, thou hast said to the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee; 
3 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight. 
4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take their names into my lips. 
5 The LORD is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot. 
6 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; yes, I have a goodly heritage. 
7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night season. 
8 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. 
9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. 
10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption. 
11 Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence is fullness of joy; at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore.
