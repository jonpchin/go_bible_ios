1 A Song of degrees. In my distress I cried to the LORD, and he heard me. 
2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue. 
3 What shall be given to thee? or what shall be done to thee, thou false tongue? 
4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper. 
5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar! 
6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 
7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
