1 A Song or Psalm of David. O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory. 
2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early. 
3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises to thee among the nations. 
4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth to the clouds. 
5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth; 
6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me. 
7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth. 
8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver; 
9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph. 
10 Who will bring me into the strong city: who will lead me into Edom? 
11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our armies? 
12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man. 
13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he will tread down our enemies.
