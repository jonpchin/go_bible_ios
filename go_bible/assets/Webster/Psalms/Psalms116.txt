1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications. 
2 Because he hath inclined his ear to me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live. 
3 The sorrows of death encompassed me, and the pains of hell came upon me: I found trouble and sorrow. 
4 Then I called upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul. 
5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yes, our God is merciful. 
6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me. 
7 Return to thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee. 
8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling. 
9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living. 
10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted: 
11 I said in my haste, All men are liars. 
12 What shall I render to the LORD for all his benefits towards me? 
13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD. 
14 I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all his people. 
15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints. 
16 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds. 
17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD. 
18 I will pay my vows to the LORD now in the presence of all his people, 
19 In the courts of the LORD'S house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
