1 A Psalm of David. I will sing of mercy and judgment: to thee, O LORD, will I sing. 
2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come to me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. 
3 I will set no wicked thing before my eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me. 
4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person. 
5 Whoever privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I cut off: him that hath a high look and a proud heart I will not suffer. 
6 My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. 
7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight. 
8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all who practice wickedness from the city of the LORD.
