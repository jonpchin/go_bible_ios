1 A Psalm of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
2 When the wicked, even my enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. 
3 Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. 
4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple. 
5 For in the time of trouble he will hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle will he hide me; he will set me up upon a rock. 
6 And now shall my head be lifted above my enemies around me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yes, I will sing praises to the LORD. 
7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me. 
8 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said to thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek. 
9 Hide not thy face from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation. 
10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up. 
11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of my enemies. 
12 Deliver me not over to the will of my enemies: for false witnesses have risen against me, and such as breathe out cruelty. 
13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living. 
14 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he will strengthen thy heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
