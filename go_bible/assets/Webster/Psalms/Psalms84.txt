1 To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm for the sons of Korah. How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts! 
2 My soul longeth, and even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God. 
3 Yes, the sparrow hath found a house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thy altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God. 
4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah. 
5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them. 
6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools. 
7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God. 
8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah. 
9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thy anointed. 
10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 
12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
