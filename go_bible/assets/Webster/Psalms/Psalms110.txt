1 A Psalm of David. The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool. 
2 The LORD will send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thy enemies. 
3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness: from the womb of the morning, thou hast the dew of thy youth. 
4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek. 
5 The Lord at thy right hand will strike through kings in the day of his wrath. 
6 He will judge among the heathen, he will fill the places with the dead bodies; he will wound the heads over many countries. 
7 He will drink of the brook in the way: therefore will he lift up the head.
