1 A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how are they multiplied that trouble me? many are they that rise up against me. 
2 Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah. 
3 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head. 
4 I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he heard me from his holy hill. Selah. 
5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me. 
6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me on all sides. 
7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly. 
8 Salvation belongeth to the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
