1 To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth the work of his hands. 
2 Day to day uttereth speech, and night to night showeth knowledge. 
3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard. 
4 Their line hath gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, 
5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. 
6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit to the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from his heat. 
7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple. 
8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes. 
9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether. 
10 More to be desired are they than gold, yes, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honey-comb. 
11 Moreover, by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward. 
12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults. 
13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression. 
14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
