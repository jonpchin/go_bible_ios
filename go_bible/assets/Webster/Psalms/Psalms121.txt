1 A Song of degrees. I will lift up my eyes to the hills, from whence cometh my help. 
2 My help cometh from the LORD, who made heaven and earth. 
3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 
4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 
5 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right hand. 
6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 
7 The LORD will preserve thee from all evil: he will preserve thy soul. 
8 The LORD will preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for ever.
