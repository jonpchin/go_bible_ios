1 A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day. It is a good thing to give thanks to the LORD, and to sing praises to thy name, O Most High. 
2 To show forth thy loving-kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night. 
3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound. 
4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands. 
5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep. 
6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this. 
7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever: 
8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore. 
9 For lo, thy enemies, O LORD, for lo, thy enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. 
10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil. 
11 My eye also shall see my desire on my enemies, and my ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me. 
12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. 
13 Those that are planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God. 
14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing; 
15 To show that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
