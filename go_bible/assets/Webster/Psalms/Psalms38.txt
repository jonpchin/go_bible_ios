1 A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. 
2 For thy arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand falleth heavy upon me. 
3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thy anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin. 
4 For my iniquities have gone over my head: as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me. 
5 My wounds are offensive, and are corrupt because of my foolishness. 
6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long. 
7 For my loins are filled with a lothsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh. 
8 I am feeble and grievously broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart. 
9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee. 
10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of my eyes, that also is gone from me. 
11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my affliction; and my kinsmen stand afar off. 
12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long. 
13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth. 
14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs. 
15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God. 
16 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me. 
17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me. 
18 For I will declare my iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin. 
19 But my enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied. 
20 They also that render evil for good are my adversaries; because I follow the thing that is good. 
21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me. 
22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
