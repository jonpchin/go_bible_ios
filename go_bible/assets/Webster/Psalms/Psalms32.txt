1 A Psalm of David, Maschil. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. 
2 Blessed is the man to whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile. 
3 When I kept silence, my bones became old through my roaring all the day long. 
4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drouth of summer. Selah. 
5 I acknowledged my sin to thee, and my iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions to the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah. 
6 For this shall every one that is godly pray to thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh to him. 
7 Thou art my hiding place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah. 
8 I will instruct thee, and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with my eye. 
9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near to thee. 
10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall encompass him. 
11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
