1 Maschil of David; a prayer when he was in the cave. I cried to the LORD with my voice; with my voice to the LORD I made my supplication. 
2 I poured out my complaint before him; I showed before him my trouble. 
3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way in which I walked have they privily laid a snare for me. 
4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul. 
5 I cried to thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living. 
6 Attend to my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I. 
7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall encompass me; for thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
