1 O sing to the LORD a new song: sing to the LORD, all the earth. 
2 Sing to the LORD, bless his name; show forth his salvation from day to day. 
3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people. 
4 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 
5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens. 
6 Honor and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary. 
7 Give to the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give to the LORD glory and strength. 
8 Give to the LORD the glory due to his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts. 
9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth. 
10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he will judge the people righteously. 
11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fullness of it. 
12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the LORD: 
13 For he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
