1 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, 
2 That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. 
3 And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun shall be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house. 
4 Now the city was large and great: but the people in it were few, and the houses were not built. 
5 And my God put into my heart to assemble the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them who came up at the first, and found written in it, 
6 These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one to his city; 
7 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was this;

45 The porters: the children of Shallum, the children of Ater, the children of Talmon, the children of Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, a hundred and thirty eight. 
46 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hashupha, the children of Tabbaoth,

57 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida, 
58 The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel, 
59 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon. 
60 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants, were three hundred and ninety two. 
61 And these were they who went up also from Tel-mela, Tel-haresha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not show their fathers house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel. 
62 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred and forty two. 
63 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, who took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite for a wife, and was called after their name. 
64 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood. 
65 And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there should stand up a priest with Urim and Thummim. 
66 The whole congregation together was forty two thousand three hundred and sixty. 
67 Besides their man-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty seven: and they had two hundred and forty five singing-men and singing-women. 
68 Their horses, seven hundred and thirty six: their mules, two hundred and forty five: 
69 Their camels, four hundred and thirty five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses. 
70 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments. 
71 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work, twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver. 
72 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and sixty seven priests' garments. 
73 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities.
