1 After these things, Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; 
2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) and he came to them. 
3 And because he was of the same occupation, he abode with them, and wrought (for by their occupation they were tent-makers) 
4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. 
5 And when Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in spirit, and testified to the Jews, that Jesus was Christ. 
6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own heads: I am clean: from henceforth I will go to the Gentiles. 
7 And he departed thence, and entered into the house of a certain man named Justus, one that worshiped God, whose house joined close to the synagogue. 
8 And Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house: and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptized. 
9 Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: 
10 For I am with thee, and no man shall lay hands on thee, to hurt thee: for I have many people in this city. 
11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. 
12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment-seat, 
13 Saying, This man persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. 
14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong, or hainous crime, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: 
15 But if it is a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it: for I will be no judge of such matters. 
16 And he drove them from the judgment-seat. 
17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. 
18 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. 
19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. 
20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not: 
21 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return to you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. 
22 And when he had landed at Cesarea, and gone up and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. 
23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. 
24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. 
25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord: and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. 
26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: Whom, when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him to them, and expounded to him the way of God more perfectly. 
27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he had come, helped them much who had believed through grace. 
28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publicly, showing by the scriptures, that Jesus was Christ.
