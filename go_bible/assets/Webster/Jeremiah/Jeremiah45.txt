1 The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, 
2 Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, to thee, O Baruch; 
3 Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the LORD hath added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest. 
4 Thus shalt thou say to him, The LORD saith thus; Behold, that which I have built I will break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land. 
5 And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek them not: for behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD: but thy life will I give to thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.
