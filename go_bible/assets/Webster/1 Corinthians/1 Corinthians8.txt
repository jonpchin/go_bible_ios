1 Now as concerning things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth. 
2 And if any man thinketh that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know. 
3 But if any man loveth God, the same is known by him. 
4 Therefore as concerning the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one. 
5 For though there are that are called gods, whether in heaven or upon earth, (as there are gods many, and lords many) 
6 Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him. 
7 But there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 
8 But food commendeth us not to God: for neither if we eat, are we the better; neither if we eat not, are we the worse. 
9 But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours should become a stumbling-block to them that are weak. 
10 For if any man shall see thee, who hast knowledge, sit eating in the idol's temple, will not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols; 
11 And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died? 
12 But when ye thus sin against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. 
13 Wherefore, if food maketh my brother to fall into sin, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to fall into sin.
