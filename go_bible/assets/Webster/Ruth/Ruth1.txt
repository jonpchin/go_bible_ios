1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Beth-lehem-judah went to dwell in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons. 
2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Beth-lehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there. 
3 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her two sons. 
4 And they took to themselves wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelt there about ten years. 
5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left by her two sons and her husband. 
6 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread. 
7 Wherefore she went forth from the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah. 
8 And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me. 
9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept. 
10 And they said to her, surely we will return with thee to thy people. 
11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me? shall I bear more sons, that they may be your husbands? 
12 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have a husband also to-night, and should also bear sons; 
13 Would ye wait for them till they should be grown? would ye stay for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your sakes, that the hand of the LORD has gone out against me. 
14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law; but Ruth cleaved to her. 
15 And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law hath gone back to her people, and to her gods: return thou after thy sister-in-law. 
16 And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, or to return from following thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: 
17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if aught but death shall part thee and me. 
18 When she saw that she was steadfastly resolved to go with her, then she left speaking to her. 
19 So they two went until they came to Beth-lehem. And it came to pass, when they had come to Beth-lehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi? 
20 And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. 
21 I went out full, and the LORD hath brought me home again empty: why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me? 
22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who returned from the country of Moab: and they came to Beth-lehem in the beginning of barley-harvest.
