1 Then the LORD said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them from his land. 
2 And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the LORD: 
3 And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. 
4 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers. 
5 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage: and I have remembered my covenant. 
6 Wherefore say to the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with out-stretched arm, and with great judgments: 
7 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
8 And I will bring you into the land, concerning which I swore to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the LORD. 
9 And Moses spoke so to the children of Israel: but they hearkened not to Moses, by reason of anguish of spirit, and cruel bondage. 
10 And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 
11 Go in, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel depart from his land. 
12 And Moses spoke before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened to me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips? 
13 And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, and gave them a charge to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

26 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies. 
27 These are they who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron. 
28 And it came to pass, on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 
29 That the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, all that I say to thee. 
30 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken to me?
