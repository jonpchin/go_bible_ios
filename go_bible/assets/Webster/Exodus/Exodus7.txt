1 And the LORD said to Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet. 
2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land. 
3 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. 
4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken to you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by great judgments. 
5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them. 
6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they. 
7 And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty and three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh. 
8 And the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Aaron, saying, 
9 When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a miracle for you: then thou shalt say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent. 
10 And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. 
11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise-men, and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. 
12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. 
13 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart that he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said. 
14 And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened; he refuseth to let the people go. 
15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out to the water, and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he cometh; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand. 
16 And thou shalt say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear. 
17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood. 
18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall be offensive in smell; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river. 
19 And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood: and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone. 
20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned into blood. 
21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river was offensive in smell, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 
22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken to them; as the LORD had said. 
23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he regard this also. 
24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. 
25 And seven days were fulfilled after that the LORD had smitten the river.
