1 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead. 
2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; all of which bear twins, and none is barren among them. 
3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate within thy locks. 
4 Thy neck is like the tower of David built for an armory, on which hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. 
5 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies. 
6 Until the day shall break, and the shadows flee away, I will repair to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. 
7 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee. 
8 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards. 
9 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thy eyes, with one chain of thy neck. 
10 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thy ointments than all spices! 
11 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honey-comb; honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon. 
12 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. 
13 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphor, with spikenard, 
14 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices: 
15 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon. 
16 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
