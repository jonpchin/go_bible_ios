1 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman. 
2 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies. 
3 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins. 
4 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thy eyes like the fish-pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh towards Damascus. 
5 Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple; the king is held in the galleries. 
6 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights! 
7 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes. 
8 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of its boughs: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples; 
9 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak. 
10 I am my beloved's, and his desire is towards me. 
11 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages. 
12 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourisheth, whether the tender grape appeareth, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves. 
13 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
