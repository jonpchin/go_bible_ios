1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 
2 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, be multiplied. 
3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again to a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 
4 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, 
5 Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. 
6 In which ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season (if need be) ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations: 
7 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though tried with fire, might be found to praise, and honor, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 
8 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable, and full of glory: 
9 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your souls. 
10 Concerning which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come to you: 
11 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow. 
12 To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they ministered the things which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you, with the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into. 
13 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ; 
14 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance: 
15 But as he who hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of deportment. 
16 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy. 
17 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear: 
18 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain course of life received by tradition from your fathers; 
19 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: 
20 Who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in these last times for you, 
21 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God. 
22 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit to unfeigned love of the brethren, see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: 
23 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever. 
24 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and its flower falleth away: 
25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.
