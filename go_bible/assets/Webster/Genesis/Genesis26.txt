1 And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar. 
2 And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt: dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of. 
3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: for to thee, and to thy seed I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham thy father; 
4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to thy seed all these countries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed: 
5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. 
6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: 
7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon. 
8 And it came to pass when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. 
9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, surely she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? and Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I should die on her account. 
10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done to us? one of the people might lightly have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldst have brought guiltiness upon us. 
11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. 
12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year a hundred-fold: and the LORD blessed him: 
13 And the man became great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: 
14 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and very many servants: And the Philistines envied him. 
15 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. 
16 And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us: for thou art much mightier than we. 
17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. 
18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. 
19 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. 
20 And the herdmen of Gerar contended with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. 
21 And they digged another well, and contended for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. 
22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they did not contend: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. 
23 And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba. 
24 And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake. 
25 And he built an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well. 
26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. 
27 And Isaac said to them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 
28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; 
29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done to thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. 
30 And he made them a feast, and they ate and drank. 
31 And they rose betimes in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. 
32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said to him, We have found water. 
33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day. 
34 And Esau was forty years old when he took for a wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 
35 Who were a grief of mind to Isaac and Rebekah.
