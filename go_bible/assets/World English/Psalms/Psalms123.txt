1 To you I do lift up my eyes, you who sit in the heavens.
2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes look to Yahweh, our God, until he has mercy on us.
3 Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, for we have endured much contempt.
4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who are at ease, with the contempt of the proud. A Song of Ascents. By David.
