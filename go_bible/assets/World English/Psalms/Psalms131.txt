1 Yahweh, my heart isn't haughty, nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters, or things too wonderful for me.
2 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
3 Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore. A Song of Ascents.
