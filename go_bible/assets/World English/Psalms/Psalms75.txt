1 We give thanks to you, God. We give thanks, for your Name is near. Men tell about your wondrous works.
2 When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly.
3 The earth and all its inhabitants quake. I firmly hold its pillars. Selah.
4 I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!" I said to the wicked, "Don't lift up the horn.
5 Don't lift up your horn on high. Don't speak with a stiff neck."
6 For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from the south, comes exaltation.
7 But God is the judge. He puts down one, and lifts up another.
8 For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, full of foaming wine mixed with spices. He pours it out. Indeed the wicked of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
9 But I will declare this forever: I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
10 I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up. For the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments. A Psalm by Asaph. A song.
