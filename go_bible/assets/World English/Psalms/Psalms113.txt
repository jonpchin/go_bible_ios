1 Praise Yah! Praise, you servants of Yahweh, praise the name of Yahweh.
2 Blessed be the name of Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.
3 From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same, Yahweh's name is to be praised.
4 Yahweh is high above all nations, his glory above the heavens.
5 Who is like Yahweh, our God, who has his seat on high,
6 Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
7 He raises up the poor out of the dust. Lifts up the needy from the ash heap;
8 that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
9 He settles the barren woman in her home, as a joyful mother of children. Praise Yah!
