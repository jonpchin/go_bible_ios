1 Out of the depths I have cried to you, Yahweh.
2 Lord, hear my voice. Let your ears be attentive to the voice of my petitions.
3 If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
4 But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared.
5 I wait for Yahweh. My soul waits. I hope in his word.
6 My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning; more than watchmen for the morning.
7 Israel, hope in Yahweh, for with Yahweh there is loving kindness. With him is abundant redemption.
8 He will redeem Israel from all their sins. A Song of Ascents. By David.
