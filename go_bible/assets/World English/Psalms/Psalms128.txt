1 Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh, who walks in his ways.
2 For you will eat the labor of your hands. You will be happy, and it will be well with you.
3 Your wife will be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost parts of your house; your children like olive plants, around your table.
4 Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears Yahweh.
5 May Yahweh bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
6 Yes, may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel. A Song of Ascents.
