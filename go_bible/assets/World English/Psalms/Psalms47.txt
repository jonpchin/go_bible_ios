1 Oh clap your hands, all you nations. Shout to God with the voice of triumph!
2 For Yahweh Most High is awesome. He is a great King over all the earth.
3 He subdues nations under us, and peoples under our feet.
4 He chooses our inheritance for us, the glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
5 God has gone up with a shout, Yahweh with the sound of a trumpet.
6 Sing praise to God, sing praises. Sing praises to our King, sing praises.
7 For God is the King of all the earth. Sing praises with understanding.
8 God reigns over the nations. God sits on his holy throne.
9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together, the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God. He is greatly exalted! A Song. A Psalm by the sons of Korah.
