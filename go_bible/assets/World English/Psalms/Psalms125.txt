1 Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion, which can't be moved, but remains forever.
2 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Yahweh surrounds his people from this time forth and forevermore.
3 For the scepter of wickedness won't remain over the allotment of the righteous; so that the righteous won't use their hands to do evil.
4 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, to those who are upright in their hearts.
5 But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways, Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be on Israel. A Song of Ascents.
