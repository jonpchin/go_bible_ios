1 Oh that you would tear the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might quake at your presence,
2 as when fire kindles the brushwood, [and] the fire causes the waters to boil; to make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!
3 When you did awesome things which we didn't look for, you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
4 For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen a God besides you, who works for him who waits for him.
5 You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember you in your ways. Behold, you were angry, and we sinned. We have been in sin for a long time; and shall we be saved?
6 For we have all become as one who is unclean, and all our righteousness is as a polluted garment: and we all fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
7 There is none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself to take hold of you; for you have hidden your face from us, and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.
8 But now, Yahweh, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.
9 Don't be furious, Yahweh, neither remember iniquity forever: see, look, we beg you, we are all your people.
10 Your holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
11 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.
12 Will you refrain yourself for these things, Yahweh? Will you hold your peace, and afflict us very severely?
