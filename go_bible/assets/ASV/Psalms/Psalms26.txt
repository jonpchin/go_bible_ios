1 [A Psalm] of David. Judge me, O Jehovah, for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in Jehovah without wavering.
2 Examine me, O Jehovah, and prove me; Try my heart and my mind.
3 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes; And I have walked in thy truth.
4 I have not sat with men of falsehood; Neither will I go in with dissemblers.
5 I hate the assembly of evil-doers, And will not sit with the wicked.
6 I will wash my hands in innocency: So will I compass thine altar, O Jehovah;
7 That I may make the voice of thanksgiving to be heard, And tell of all thy wondrous works.
8 Jehovah, I love the habitation of thy house, And the place where thy glory dwelleth.
9 Gather not my soul with sinners, Nor my life with men of blood;
10 In whose hands is wickedness, And their right hand is full of bribes.
11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: Redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
12 My foot standeth in an even place: In the congregations will I bless Jehovah.
