1 O Jehovah, thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, Thou God to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.
2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: Render to the proud [their] desert.
3 Jehovah, how long shall the wicked, How long shall the wicked triumph?
4 They prate, they speak arrogantly: All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.
5 They break in pieces thy people, O Jehovah, And afflict thy heritage.
6 They slay the widow and the sojourner, And murder the fatherless.
7 And they say, Jehovah will not see, Neither will the God of Jacob consider.
8 Consider, ye brutish among the people; And ye fools, when will ye be wise?
9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
10 He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct, [Even] he that teacheth man knowledge?
11 Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of man, That they are vanity.
12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Jehovah, And teachest out of thy law;
13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, Until the pit be digged for the wicked.
14 For Jehovah will not cast off his people, Neither will he forsake his inheritance.
15 For judgment shall return unto righteousness; And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
16 Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers? Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
17 Unless Jehovah had been my help, My soul had soon dwelt in silence.
18 When I said, My foot slippeth; Thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, held me up.
19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me Thy comforts delight my soul.
20 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee, Which frameth mischief by statute?
21 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, And condemn the innocent blood.
22 But Jehovah hath been my high tower, And my God the rock of my refuge.
23 And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity, And will cut them off in their own wickedness; Jehovah our God will cut them off.
