1 For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good.
2 Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God.
3 They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah?
5 There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous.
6 Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge.
7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, [and] Israel shall be glad.
