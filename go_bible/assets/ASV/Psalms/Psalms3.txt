1 A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me.
2 Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah
3 But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head.
4 I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah
5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me.
6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.
7 Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.
8 Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah
