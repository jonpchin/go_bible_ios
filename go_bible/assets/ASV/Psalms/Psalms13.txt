1 For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?
2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
3 Consider [and] answer me, O Jehovah my God: Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the [sleep of] death;
4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; [Lest] mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.
5 But I have trusted in thy lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
6 I will sing unto Jehovah, Because he hath dealt bountifully with me.
