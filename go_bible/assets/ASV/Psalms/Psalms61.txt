1 For the Chief Musician; on a stringed instrument. [A Psalm] of David. Hear my cry, O God; Attend unto my prayer.
2 From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
3 For thou hast been a refuge for me, A strong tower from the enemy.
4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. Selah
5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: Thou hast given [me] the heritage of those that fear thy name.
6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life; His years shall be as many generations.
7 He shall abide before God for ever: Oh prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, That I may daily perform my vows.
