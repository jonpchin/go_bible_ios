1 A Psalm of David. The earth is Jehovah's, and the fulness thereof; The world, and they that dwell therein.
2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, And established it upon the floods.
3 Who shall ascend into the hill of Jehovah? And who shall stand in his holy place?
4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; Who hath not lifted up his soul unto falsehood, And hath not sworn deceitfully.
5 He shall receive a blessing from Jehovah, And righteousness from the God of his salvation.
6 This is the generation of them that seek after him, That seek thy face, [even] Jacob. Selah
7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; And be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.
8 Who is the King of glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty in battle.
9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; Yea, lift them up, ye everlasting doors: And the King of glory will come in.
10 Who is this King of glory? Jehovah of hosts, He is the King of glory. Selah
