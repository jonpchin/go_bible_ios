1 For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Jehovah, thou hast been favorable unto thy land; Thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; Thou hast covered all their sin. Selah
3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; Thou hast turned [thyself] from the fierceness of thine anger.
4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, And cause thine indignation toward us to cease.
5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
6 Wilt thou not quicken us again, That thy people may rejoice in thee?
7 Show us thy lovingkindness, O Jehovah, And grant us thy salvation.
8 I will hear what God Jehovah will speak; For he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: But let them not turn again to folly.
9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him, That glory may dwell in our land.
10 Mercy and truth are met together; Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
11 Truth springeth out of the earth; And righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
12 Yea, Jehovah will give that which is good; And our land shall yield its increase.
13 Righteousness shall go before him, And shall make his footsteps a way [to walk in].
