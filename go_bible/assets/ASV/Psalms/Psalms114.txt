1 When Israel went forth out of Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
2 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
3 The sea saw it, and fled; The Jordan was driven back.
4 The mountains skipped like rams, The little hills like lambs.
5 What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest? Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back?
6 Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams; Ye little hills, like lambs?
7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, At the presence of the God of Jacob,
8 Who turned the rock into a pool of water, The flint into a fountain of waters.
