1 For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a song. In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel.
2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, And his dwelling-place in Zion.
3 There he brake the arrows of the bow; The shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah
4 Glorious art thou [and] excellent, From the mountains of prey.
5 The stouthearted are made a spoil, They have slept their sleep; And none of the men of might have found their hands.
6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both chariot and horse are cast into a deep sleep.
7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared; And who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
8 Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,
9 When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah
10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.
11 Vow, and pay unto Jehovah your God: Let all that are round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
12 He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth.
