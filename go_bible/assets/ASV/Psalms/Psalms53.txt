1 For the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath. Maschil of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity; There is none that doeth good.
2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God.
3 Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, And call not upon God?
5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was; For God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: Thou hast put them to shame, because of God hath rejected them.
6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, [and] Israel shall be glad.
