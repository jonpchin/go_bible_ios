1 [A Psalm] of David. Maschil. Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, Whose sin is covered.
2 Blessed is the man unto whom Jehovah imputeth not iniquity, And in whose spirit there is no guile.
3 When I kept silence, my bones wasted away Through my groaning all the day long.
4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: My moisture was changed [as] with the drought of summer. Selah
5 I acknowledged my sin unto thee, And mine iniquity did I not hide: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto Jehovah; And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah
6 For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him.
7 Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble; Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah
8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.
9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in, [Else] they will not come near unto thee.
10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked; But he that trusteth in Jehovah, lovingkindness shall compass him about.
11 Be glad in Jehovah, and rejoice, ye righteous; And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
