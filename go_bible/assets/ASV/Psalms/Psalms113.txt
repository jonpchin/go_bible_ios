1 Praise ye Jehovah. Praise, O ye servants of Jehovah, Praise the name of Jehovah.
2 Blessed be the name of Jehovah From this time forth and for evermore.
3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same Jehovah's name is to be praised.
4 Jehovah is high above all nations, And his glory above the heavens.
5 Who is like unto Jehovah our God, That hath his seat on high,
6 That humbleth himself to behold [The things that are] in heaven and in the earth?
7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, And lifteth up the needy from the dunghill;
8 That he may set him with princes, Even with the princes of his people.
9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, [And to be] a joyful mother of children. Praise ye Jehovah.
