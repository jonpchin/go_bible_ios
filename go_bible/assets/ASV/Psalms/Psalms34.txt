1 A Psalm of David; when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed. I will bless Jehovah at all times: His praise shall continually be in my mouth.
2 My soul shall make her boast in Jehovah: The meek shall hear thereof, and be glad.
3 Oh magnify Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together.
4 I sought Jehovah, and he answered me, And delivered me from all my fears.
5 They looked unto him, and were radiant; And their faces shall never be confounded.
6 This poor man cried, and Jehovah heard him, And saved him out of all his troubles.
7 The angel of Jehovah encampeth round about them that fear him, And delivereth them.
8 Oh taste and see that Jehovah is good: Blessed is the man that taketh refuge in him.
9 Oh fear Jehovah, ye his saints; For there is no want to them that fear him.
10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; But they that seek Jehovah shall not want any good thing.
11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of Jehovah.
12 What man is he that desireth life, And loveth [many] days, that he may see good?
13 Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking guile.
14 Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it.
15 The eyes of Jehovah are toward the righteous, And his ears are [open] unto their cry.
16 The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, To cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.
17 [The righteous] cried, and Jehovah heard, And delivered them out of all their troubles.
18 Jehovah is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, And saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.
19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous; But Jehovah delivereth him out of them all.
20 He keepeth all his bones: Not one of them is broken.
21 Evil shall slay the wicked; And they that hate the righteous shall be condemned.
22 Jehovah redeemeth the soul of his servants; And none of them that take refuge in him shall be condemned.
