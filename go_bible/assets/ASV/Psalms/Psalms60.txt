1 For the Chief Musician; [set to] Shushan Eduth. Michtam of David, to teach; and when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand. O God thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; oh restore us again.
2 Thou hast made the land to tremble; thou hast rent it: Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
3 Thou hast showed thy people hard things: Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.
4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, That it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah
5 That thy beloved may be delivered, Save with thy right hand, and answer us.
6 God hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult; I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the defence of my head; Judah is my sceptre.
8 Moab is my washpot; Upon Edom will I cast my shoe: Philistia, shout thou because of me.
9 Who will bring me into the strong city? Who hath led me unto Edom?
10 Hast not thou, O God, cast us off? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.
11 Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.
12 Through God we shall do valiantly; For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
