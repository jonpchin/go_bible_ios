1 For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Oh clap your hands, all ye peoples; Shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
2 For Jehovah Most High is terrible; He is a great King over all the earth.
3 He subdueth peoples under us, And nations under our feet.
4 He chooseth our inheritance for us, The glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah
5 God is gone up with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.
6 Sing praise to God, sing praises: Sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
7 For God is the King of all the earth: Sing ye praises with understanding.
8 God reigneth over the nations: God sitteth upon his holy throne.
9 The princes of the peoples are gathered together [To be] the people of the God of Abraham: For the shields of the earth belong unto God; He is greatly exalted.
