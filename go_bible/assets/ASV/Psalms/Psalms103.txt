1 [A Psalm] of David. Bless Jehovah, O my soul; And all that is within me, [bless] his holy name.
2 Bless Jehovah, O my soul, And forget not all his benefits:
3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; Who healeth all thy diseases;
4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
5 Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, [So that] thy youth is renewed like the eagle.
6 Jehovah executeth righteous acts, And judgments for all that are oppressed.
7 He made known his ways unto Moses, His doings unto the children of Israel.
8 Jehovah is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.
9 He will not always chide; Neither will he keep [his anger] for ever.
10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins, Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.
11 For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him.
12 As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
13 Like as a father pitieth his children, So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.
14 For he knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust.
15 As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; And the place thereof shall know it no more.
17 But the lovingkindness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, And his righteousness unto children's children;
18 To such as keep his covenant, And to those that remember his precepts to do them.
19 Jehovah hath established his throne in the heavens; And his kingdom ruleth over all.
20 Bless Jehovah, ye his angels, That are mighty in strength, that fulfil his word, Hearkening unto the voice of his word.
21 Bless Jehovah, all ye his hosts, Ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
22 Bless Jehovah, all ye his works, In all places of his dominion: Bless Jehovah, O my soul.
