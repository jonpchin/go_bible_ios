1 A Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise unto Jehovah, all ye lands.
2 Serve Jehovah with gladness: Come before his presence with singing.
3 Know ye that Jehovah, he is God: It is he that hath made us, and we are his; We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, And into his courts with praise: Give thanks unto him, and bless his name.
5 For Jehovah is good; his lovingkindness [endureth] for ever, And his faithfulness unto all generations.
