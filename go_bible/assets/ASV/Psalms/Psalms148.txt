1 Praise ye Jehovah. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens: Praise him in the heights.
2 Praise ye him, all his angels: Praise ye him, all his host.
3 Praise ye him, sun and moon: Praise him, all ye stars of light.
4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, And ye waters that are above the heavens.
5 Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For he commanded, and they were created.
6 He hath also established them for ever and ever: He hath made a decree which shall not pass away.
7 Praise Jehovah from the earth, Ye sea-monsters, and all deeps.
8 Fire and hail, snow and vapor; Stormy wind, fulfilling his word;
9 Mountains and all hills; Fruitful trees and all cedars;
10 Beasts and all cattle; Creeping things and flying birds;
11 Kings of the earth and all peoples; Princes and all judges of the earth;
12 Both young men and virgins; Old men and children:
13 Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For his name alone is exalted; His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
14 And he hath lifted up the horn of his people, The praise of all his saints; Even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye Jehovah.
