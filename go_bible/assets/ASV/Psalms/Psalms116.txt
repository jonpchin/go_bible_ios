1 I love Jehovah, because he heareth My voice and my supplications.
2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, Therefore will I call [upon him] as long as I live.
3 The cords of death compassed me, And the pains of Sheol gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
4 Then called I upon the name of Jehovah: O Jehovah, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
5 Gracious is Jehovah, and righteous; Yea, our God is merciful.
6 Jehovah preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he saved me.
7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; For Jehovah hath dealt bountifully with thee.
8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, Mine eyes from tears, [And] my feet from falling.
9 I will walk before Jehovah In the land of the living.
10 I believe, for I will speak: I was greatly afflicted:
11 I said in my haste, All men are liars.
12 What shall I render unto Jehovah For all his benefits toward me?
13 I will take the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of Jehovah.
14 I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people.
15 Precious in the sight of Jehovah Is the death of his saints.
16 O Jehovah, truly I am thy servant: I am thy servant, the son of thy handmaid; Thou hast loosed my bonds.
17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of Jehovah.
18 I will pay my vows unto Jehovah, Yea, in the presence of all his people,
19 In the courts of Jehovah's house, In the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye Jehovah.
