1 For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of David; when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not David hide himself with us? Save me, O God, by thy name, And judge me in thy might.
2 Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.
3 For strangers are risen up against me, And violent men have sought after my soul: They have not set God before them. Selah
4 Behold, God is my helper: The Lord is of them that uphold my soul.
5 He will requite the evil unto mine enemies: Destroy thou them in thy truth.
6 With a freewill-offering will I sacrifice unto thee: I will give thanks unto thy name, O Jehovah, for it is good.
7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble; And mine eye hath seen [my desire] upon mine enemies.
