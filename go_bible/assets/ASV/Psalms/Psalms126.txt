1 A Song of Ascents. When Jehovah brought back those that returned to Zion, We were like unto them that dream.
2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, And our tongue with singing: Then said they among the nations, Jehovah hath done great things for them.
3 Jehovah hath done great things for us, [Whereof] we are glad.
4 Turn again our captivity, O Jehovah, As the streams in the South.
5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing, Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves [with him].
