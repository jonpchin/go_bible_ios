1 A Song of Ascents. They that trust in Jehovah Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever.
2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, So Jehovah is round about his people From this time forth and for evermore.
3 For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.
4 Do good, O Jehovah, unto those that are good, And to them that are upright in their hearts.
5 But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, Jehovah will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel.
