1 Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God; for in thee do I take refuge.
2 [O my soul], thou hast said unto Jehovah, Thou art my Lord: I have no good beyond thee.
3 As for the saints that are in the earth, They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.
4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that give gifts for another [god]: Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, Nor take their names upon my lips.
5 Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: Thou maintainest my lot.
6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly heritage.
7 I will bless Jehovah, who hath given me counsel; Yea, my heart instructeth me in the night seasons.
8 I have set Jehovah always before me: Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; My flesh also shall dwell in safety.
10 For thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol; Neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption.
11 Thou wilt show me the path of life: In thy presence is fulness of joy; In thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
