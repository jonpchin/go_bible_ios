1 For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm, a song. God be merciful unto us, and bless us, [And] cause his face to shine upon us; Selah
2 That thy way may be known upon earth, Thy salvation among all nations.
3 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise thee.
4 Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy; For thou wilt judge the peoples with equity, And govern the nations upon earth. Selah
5 Let the peoples praise thee, O God; Let all the peoples praise thee.
6 The earth hath yielded its increase: God, even our own God, will bless us.
7 God will bless us; And all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
