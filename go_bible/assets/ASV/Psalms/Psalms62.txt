1 For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthan. A Psalm of David. My soul waiteth in silence for God only: From him [cometh] my salvation.
2 He only is my rock and my salvation: [He is] my high tower; I shall not be greatly moved.
3 How long will ye set upon a man, That ye may slay [him], all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?
4 They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah
5 My soul, wait thou in silence for God only; For my expectation is from him.
6 He only is my rock and my salvation: [He is] my high tower; I shall not be moved.
7 With God is my salvation and my glory: The rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
8 Trust in him at all times, ye people; Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah
9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: In the balances they will go up; They are together lighter than vanity.
10 Trust not in oppression, And become not vain in robbery: If riches increase, set not your heart [thereon].
11 God hath spoken once, Twice have I heard this, That power belongeth unto God.
12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth lovingkindness; For thou renderest to every man according to his work.
