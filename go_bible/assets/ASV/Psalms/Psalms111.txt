1 Praise ye Jehovah. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart, In the council of the upright, and in the congregation.
2 The works of Jehovah are great, Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
3 His work is honor and majesty; And his righteousness endureth for ever.
4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: Jehovah is gracious and merciful.
5 He hath given food unto them that fear him: He will ever be mindful of his covenant.
6 He hath showed his people the power of his works, In giving them the heritage of the nations.
7 The works of his hands are truth and justice; All his precepts are sure.
8 They are established for ever and ever; They are done in truth and uprightness.
9 He hath sent redemption unto his people; He hath commanded his covenant for ever: Holy and reverend is his name.
10 The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; A good understanding have all they that do [his commandments]: His praise endureth for ever.
