1 A Psalm of David, to bring to remembrance. O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thy wrath; Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, And thy hand presseth me sore.
3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation; Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
4 For mine iniquities are gone over my head: As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
5 My wounds are loathsome and corrupt, Because of my foolishness.
6 I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
7 For my loins are filled with burning; And there is no soundness in my flesh.
8 I am faint and sore bruised: I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; And my groaning is not hid from thee.
10 My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me: As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague; And my kinsmen stand afar off.
12 They also that seek after my life lay snares [for me]; And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, And meditate deceits all the day long.
13 But I, as a deaf man, hear not; And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
14 Yea, I am as a man that heareth not, And in whose mouth are no reproofs.
15 For in thee, O Jehovah, do I hope: Thou wilt answer, O Lord my God.
16 For I said, Lest they rejoice over me: When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
17 For I am ready to fall, And my sorrow is continually before me.
18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
19 But mine enemies are lively, [and] are strong; And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
20 They also that render evil for good Are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.
21 Forsake me not, O Jehovah: O my God, be not far from me.
22 Make haste to help me, O Lord, my salvation.
