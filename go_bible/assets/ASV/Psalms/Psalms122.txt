1 A Song of Ascents; of David. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of Jehovah.
2 Our feet are standing Within thy gates, O Jerusalem,
3 Jerusalem, that art builded As a city that is compact together;
4 Whither the tribes go up, even the tribes of Jehovah, [For] an ordinance for Israel, To give thanks unto the name of Jehovah.
5 For there are set thrones for judgment, The thrones of the house of David.
6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They shall prosper that love thee.
7 Peace be within thy walls, And prosperity within thy palaces.
8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
9 For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God I will seek thy good.
