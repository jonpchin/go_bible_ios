1 For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tash-heth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; For my soul taketh refuge in thee: Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, Until [these] calamities be overpast.
2 I will cry unto God Most High, Unto God that performeth [all things] for me.
3 He will send from heaven, and save me, [When] he that would swallow me up reproacheth; Selah God will send forth his lovingkindness and his truth.
4 My soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.
5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [Let] thy glory [be] above all the earth.
6 They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me; They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah
7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing, yea, I will sing praises.
8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake right early.
9 I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the peoples: I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
10 For thy lovingkindness is great unto the heavens, And thy truth unto the skies.
11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; [Let] thy glory [be] above all the earth.
