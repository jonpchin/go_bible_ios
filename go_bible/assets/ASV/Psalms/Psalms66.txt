1 For the Chief Musician. A song, a Psalm. Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth:
2 Sing forth the glory of his name: Make his praise glorious.
3 Say unto God, How terrible are thy works! Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
4 All the earth shall worship thee, And shall sing unto thee; They shall sing to thy name. Selah
5 Come, and see the works of God; [He is] terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
6 He turned the sea into dry land; They went through the river on foot: There did we rejoice in him.
7 He ruleth by his might for ever; His eyes observe the nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah
8 Oh bless our God, ye peoples, And make the voice of his praise to be heard;
9 Who holdeth our soul in life, And suffereth not our feet to be moved.
10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
11 Thou broughtest us into the net; Thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins.
12 Thou didst cause men to ride over our heads; We went through fire and through water; But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
13 I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my vows,
14 Which my lips uttered, And my mouth spake, when I was in distress.
15 I will offer unto thee burnt-offerings of fatlings, With the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah
16 Come, and hear, all ye that fear God, And I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
17 I cried unto him with my mouth, And he was extolled with my tongue.
18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear:
19 But verily God hath heard; He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
20 Blessed be God, Who hath not turned away my prayer, Nor his lovingkindness from me.
