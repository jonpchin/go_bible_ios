1 Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
2 to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
3 For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
4 But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,
5 not by works [done] in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
6 which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;
7 that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
8 Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:
9 but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
10 A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse;
11 knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
13 Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
14 And let our [people] also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
15 All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.
