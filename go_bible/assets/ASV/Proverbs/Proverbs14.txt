1 Every wise woman buildeth her house; But the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands.
2 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth Jehovah; But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.
3 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for [his] pride; But the lips of the wise shall preserve them.
4 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean; But much increase is by the strength of the ox.
5 A faithful witness will not lie; But a false witness uttereth lies.
6 A scoffer seeketh wisdom, and [findeth it] not; But knowledge is easy unto him that hath understanding.
7 Go into the presence of a foolish man, And thou shalt not perceive [in him] the lips of knowledge.
8 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way; But the folly of fools is deceit.
9 A trespass-offering mocketh fools; But among the upright there is good will.
10 The heart knoweth its own bitterness; And a stranger doth not intermeddle with its joy.
11 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown; But the tent of the upright shall flourish.
12 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; But the end thereof are the ways of death.
13 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; And the end of mirth is heaviness.
14 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways; And a good man [shall be satisfied] from himself.
15 The simple believeth every word; But the prudent man looketh well to his going.
16 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil; But the fool beareth himself insolently, and is confident.
17 He that is soon angry will deal foolishly; And a man of wicked devices is hated.
18 The simple inherit folly; But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
19 The evil bow down before the good; And the wicked, at the gates of the righteous.
20 The poor is hated even of his own neighbor; But the rich hath many friends.
21 He that despiseth his neighbor sinneth; But he that hath pity on the poor, happy is he.
22 Do they not err that devise evil? But mercy and truth [shall be to] them that devise good.
23 In all labor there is profit; But the talk of the lips [tendeth] only to penury.
24 The crown of the wise is their riches; [But] the folly of fools is [only] folly.
25 A true witness delivereth souls; But he that uttereth lies [causeth] deceit.
26 In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence; And his children shall have a place of refuge.
27 The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death.
28 In the multitude of people is the king's glory; But in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.
29 He that is slow to anger is of great understanding; But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.
30 A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh; But envy is the rottenness of the bones.
31 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; But he that hath mercy on the needy honoreth him.
32 The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing; But the righteous hath a refuge in his death.
33 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding; But [that which is] in the inward part of fools is made known.
34 Righteousness exalteth a nation; But sin is a reproach to any people.
35 The king's favor is toward a servant that dealeth wisely; But his wrath will be [against] him that causeth shame.
