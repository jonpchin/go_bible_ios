1 He that separateth himself seeketh [his own] desire, And rageth against all sound wisdom.
2 A fool hath no delight in understanding, But only that his heart may reveal itself.
3 When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt, And with ignominy [cometh] reproach.
4 The words of a man's mouth are [as] deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom is [as] a flowing brook.
5 To respect the person of the wicked is not good, [Nor] to turn aside the righteous in judgment.
6 A fool's lips enter into contention, And his mouth calleth for stripes.
7 A fool's mouth is his destruction, And his lips are the snare of his soul.
8 The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts.
9 He also that is slack in his work Is brother to him that is a destroyer.
10 The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; The righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
11 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, And as a high wall in his own imagination.
12 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; And before honor [goeth] humility.
13 He that giveth answer before he heareth, It is folly and shame unto him.
14 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; But a broken spirit who can bear?
15 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
16 A man's gift maketh room for him, And bringeth him before great men.
17 He that pleadeth his cause first [seemeth] just; But his neighbor cometh and searcheth him out.
18 The lot causeth contentions to cease, And parteth between the mighty.
19 A brother offended [is harder to be won] than a strong city; And [such] contentions are like the bars of a castle.
20 A man's belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.
21 Death and life are in the power of the tongue; And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, And obtaineth favor of Jehovah.
23 The poor useth entreaties; But the rich answereth roughly.
24 He that maketh many friends [doeth it] to his own destruction; But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
