1 Come, and let us return unto Jehovah; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
2 After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.
3 And let us know, let us follow on to know Jehovah: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.

7 But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
8 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is stained with blood.
9 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness.
10 In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there whoredom is [found] in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
11 Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee, when I bring back the captivity of my people.
