1 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
2 The more [the prophets] called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.
3 Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
4 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them.
5 They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return [to me].
6 And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour [them], because of their own counsels.
7 And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to [him that is] on high, none at all will exalt [him].
8 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? [how] shall I cast thee off, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? [how] shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together.
9 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath.
10 They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.
11 They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah.
12 Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.
