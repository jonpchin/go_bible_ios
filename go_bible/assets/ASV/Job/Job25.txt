1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
2 Dominion and fear are with him; He maketh peace in his high places.
3 Is there any number of his armies? And upon whom doth not his light arise?
4 How then can man be just with God? Or how can he be clean that is born of a woman?
5 Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, And the stars are not pure in his sight:
6 How much less man, that is a worm! And the son of man, that is a worm!
