1 Then Job answered and said,
2 Even to-day is my complaint rebellious: My stroke is heavier than my groaning.
3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!
4 I would set my cause in order before him, And fill my mouth with arguments.
5 I would know the words which he would answer me, And understand what he would say unto me.
6 Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.
7 There the upright might reason with him; So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not [there]; And backward, but I cannot perceive him;
9 On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.
10 But he knoweth the way that I take; When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
11 My foot hath held fast to his steps; His way have I kept, and turned not aside.
12 I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
13 But he is in one [mind], and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
14 For he performeth that which is appointed for me: And many such things are with him.
15 Therefore am I terrified at his presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him.
16 For God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath terrified me;
17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.
